# Scraper

Here's some doucmentation for how to set up and run the scraper in `src/scraper`.

Run `yarn` to install the node modules.

Run `node script.js` to run the scraper.

The scraper depends on playwright and is ensured to work on both Windows and OSX.

See `src/scraper.json` for scraper output.
